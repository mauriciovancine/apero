## Resumo

Invasive species can significantly affect native species when their  niches are similar. Ecological and morphological similarities between  the invasive Australian palm, *Archontophoenix cunninghamiana,* and the native palm from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, *Euterpe edulis*, suggest that they have similar environmental requirements and  functional roles (i.e., the function a species performs in an  ecosystem). This similarity raises concerns about how the invasive palm  could impact the native species in the present and future. We used  spatial (species occurrences) and ecological information (frugivory  events) to characterize the environmental niche and functional role of  the two palms and assess their overlap. In addition, we predicted the  potential area of occurrence of each palm within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest under current and future climate conditions. We estimated the  environmental conditions used by the invasive plant based on its native  distribution only, and based on all areas where the species is able to  establish across the globe. We found that the environmental niches of  the two palm species overlap up to 39%, which corresponds to 50% of the  current geographic distribution of E. edulis in the Atlantic Forest. In  the areas where the two species potentially co-occur, the impact of the  invasive species on the native should be influenced by the invasive  species interactions with frugivores. We found that the frugivory  functional role of the two palms was similar (84% overlap) which suggest that *A. cunninghamiana* might disrupt the seed dispersal of the  native palm. However, co-occurrence between the palms may decline with  future climate change, as the potentially environmental suitable area  for the invasive palm is predicted to decline by 10% to 55%. Evaluating  the similarity in both the environmental niche, of the native and global extent, and the functional role of native and invasive plants provides a detailed understanding of the potential impact of invasive species on  native species now and in the future.
